# BayWalk
BayWalk turns an on-site bay walk into deployable artifacts—camera coverage and occlusion maps, edge sizing (Jetson vs IPC), PoE/power budgets and hardware BOMs, Terraform/Helm/K8s manifests, Ignition/OPC-UA + MQTT mappings, Jira epics/stories, and a signed compliance bundle—operating one sprint ahead with OPA policy gates and cost rollups.
